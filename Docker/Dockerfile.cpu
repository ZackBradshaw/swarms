# This is a basic Dockerfile and might need to be adjusted according to your specific application's needs. Please replace the placeholders for environment variables with your actual keys. Also, remember not to expose sensitive data like API keys in your Dockerfile or any version control systems.

# When building and running this Docker container, be sure to allocate enough resources (especially GPU memory) for your chosen visual foundation model if running on a machine with an NVIDIA GPU. You may need to use nvidia-docker or Docker's --gpus option when running the container. The GPU memory usage you provided would be valuable for this purpose.

# It's important to note that Docker inherently does not fully support GPUs. As a result, running GPU-accelerated code within Docker requires a special runtime like NVIDIA Docker. For more complex orchestration, a platform like Kubernetes can be more effective.

# Lastly, since your application seems to be using Redis (CELERY_BROKER_URL), you might need to set up a separate Redis service as well. This can be accomplished by creating a multi-container Docker application using Docker Compose or Kubernetes.
