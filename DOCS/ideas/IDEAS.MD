## Swarming Architectures

Here are three examples of swarming architectures that could be applied in this context.

1. **Hierarchical Swarms**: In this architecture, a 'lead' agent coordinates the efforts of other agents, distributing tasks based on each agent's unique strengths. The lead agent might be equipped with additional functionality or decision-making capabilities to effectively manage the swarm.

2. **Collaborative Swarms**: Here, each agent in the swarm works in parallel, potentially on different aspects of a task. They then collectively determine the best output, often through a voting or consensus mechanism.

3. **Competitive Swarms**: In this setup, multiple agents work on the same task independently. The output from the agent which produces the highest confidence or quality result is then selected. This can often lead to more robust outputs, as the competition drives each agent to perform at its best.

4. **Multi-Agent Debate**: Here, multiple agents debate a topic. The output from the agent which produces the highest confidence or quality result is then selected. This can lead to more robust outputs, as the competition drives each agent to perform it's best.


# Ideas

A swarm, particularly in the context of distributed computing, refers to a large number of coordinated agents or nodes that work together to solve a problem. The specific requirements of a swarm might vary depending on the task at hand, but some of the general requirements include:

1. **Distributed Nature**: The swarm should consist of multiple individual units or nodes, each capable of functioning independently.

2. **Coordination**: The nodes in the swarm need to coordinate with each other to ensure they're working together effectively. This might involve communication between nodes, or it could be achieved through a central orchestrator.

3. **Scalability**: A well-designed swarm system should be able to scale up or down as needed, adding or removing nodes based on the task load.

4. **Resilience**: If a node in the swarm fails, it shouldn't bring down the entire system. Instead, other nodes should be able to pick up the slack.

5. **Load Balancing**: Tasks should be distributed evenly across the nodes in the swarm to avoid overloading any single node.

6. **Interoperability**: Each node should be able to interact with others, regardless of differences in underlying hardware or software.

Integrating these requirements with Large Language Models (LLMs) can be done as follows:

1. **Distributed Nature**: Each LLM agent can be considered as a node in the swarm. These agents can be distributed across multiple servers or even geographically dispersed data centers.

2. **Coordination**: An orchestrator can manage the LLM agents, assigning tasks, coordinating responses, and ensuring effective collaboration between agents.

3. **Scalability**: As the demand for processing power increases or decreases, the number of LLM agents can be adjusted accordingly. 

4. **Resilience**: If an LLM agent goes offline or fails, the orchestrator can assign its tasks to other agents, ensuring the swarm continues functioning smoothly.

5. **Load Balancing**: The orchestrator can also handle load balancing, ensuring tasks are evenly distributed amongst the LLM agents.

6. **Interoperability**: By standardizing the input and output formats of the LLM agents, they can effectively communicate and collaborate, regardless of the specific model or configuration of each agent.

In terms of architecture, the swarm might look something like this:

```
                                           (Orchestrator)
                                             /        \
           Tools + Vector DB -- (LLM Agent)---(Communication Layer)       (Communication Layer)---(LLM Agent)-- Tools + Vector DB 
              /                  |                                           |                 \
(Task Assignment)      (Task Completion)                    (Task Assignment)       (Task Completion)
```

Each LLM agent communicates with the orchestrator through a dedicated communication layer. The orchestrator assigns tasks to each LLM agent, which the agents then complete and return. This setup allows for a high degree of flexibility, scalability, and robustness.


## Communication Layer

Communication layers play a critical role in distributed systems, enabling interaction between different nodes (agents) and the orchestrator. Here are three potential communication layers for a distributed system, including their strengths and weaknesses:

1. **Message Queuing Systems (like RabbitMQ, Kafka)**:

    - Strengths: They are highly scalable, reliable, and designed for high-throughput systems. They also ensure delivery of messages and can persist them if necessary. Furthermore, they support various messaging patterns like publish/subscribe, which can be highly beneficial in a distributed system. They also have robust community support.

    - Weaknesses: They can add complexity to the system, including maintenance of the message broker. Moreover, they require careful configuration to perform optimally, and handling failures can sometimes be challenging.

2. **RESTful APIs**:

    - Strengths: REST is widely adopted, and most programming languages have libraries to easily create RESTful APIs. They leverage standard HTTP(S) protocols and methods and are straightforward to use. Also, they can be stateless, meaning each request contains all the necessary information, enabling scalability.

    - Weaknesses: For real-time applications, REST may not be the best fit due to its synchronous nature. Additionally, handling a large number of API requests can put a strain on the system, causing slowdowns or timeouts.

3. **gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)**:

    - Strengths: gRPC uses Protocol Buffers as its interface definition language, leading to smaller payloads and faster serialization/deserialization compared to JSON (commonly used in RESTful APIs). It supports bidirectional streaming and can use HTTP/2 features, making it excellent for real-time applications.

    - Weaknesses: gRPC is more complex to set up compared to REST. Protocol Buffers' binary format can be more challenging to debug than JSON. It's also not as widely adopted as REST, so tooling and support might be limited in some environments.

In the context of swarm LLMs, one could consider an **Omni-Vector Embedding Database** for communication. This database could store and manage the high-dimensional vectors produced by each LLM agent.

- Strengths: This approach would allow for similarity-based lookup and matching of LLM-generated vectors, which can be particularly useful for tasks that involve finding similar outputs or recognizing patterns.

- Weaknesses: An Omni-Vector Embedding Database might add complexity to the system in terms of setup and maintenance. It might also require significant computational resources, depending on the volume of data being handled and the complexity of the vectors. The handling and transmission of high-dimensional vectors could also pose challenges in terms of network load.




# Technical Analysis Document: Particle Swarm of AI Agents using Ocean Database

## Overview

The goal is to create a particle swarm of AI agents using the OpenAI API for the agents and the Ocean database as the communication space, where the embeddings act as particles. The swarm will work collectively to perform tasks and optimize their behavior based on the interaction with the Ocean database.

## Algorithmic Overview

1. Initialize the AI agents and the Ocean database.
2. Assign tasks to the AI agents.
3. AI agents use the OpenAI API to perform tasks and generate embeddings.
4. AI agents store their embeddings in the Ocean database.
5. AI agents query the Ocean database for relevant embeddings.
6. AI agents update their positions based on the retrieved embeddings.
7. Evaluate the performance of the swarm and update the agents' behavior accordingly.
8. Repeat steps 3-7 until a stopping criterion is met.

## Python Implementation Logic

1. **Initialize the AI agents and the Ocean database.**

```python
import openai
import oceandb
from oceandb.utils.embedding_functions import ImageBindEmbeddingFunction

# Initialize Ocean database
client = oceandb.Client()
text_embedding_function = ImageBindEmbeddingFunction(modality="text")
collection = client.create_collection("all-my-documents", embedding_function=text_embedding_function)

# Initialize AI agents
agents = initialize_agents(...)
```

2. **Assign tasks to the AI agents.**

```python
tasks = assign_tasks_to_agents(agents, ...)
```

3. **AI agents use the OpenAI API to perform tasks and generate embeddings.**

```python
def agent_perform_task(agent, task):
    # Perform the task using the OpenAI API
    result = perform_task_with_openai_api(agent, task)
    # Generate the embedding
    embedding = generate_embedding(result)
    return embedding

embeddings = [agent_perform_task(agent, task) for agent, task in zip(agents, tasks)]
```

4. **AI agents store their embeddings in the Ocean database.**

```python
def store_embeddings_in_database(embeddings, collection):
    for i, embedding in enumerate(embeddings):
        document_id = f"agent_{i}"
        collection.add(documents=[embedding], ids=[document_id])

store_embeddings_in_database(embeddings, collection)
```

5. **AI agents query the Ocean database for relevant embeddings.**

```python
def query_database_for_embeddings(agent, collection, n_results=1):
    query_result = collection.query(query_texts=[agent], n_results=n_results)
    return query_result

queried_embeddings = [query_database_for_embeddings(agent, collection) for agent in agents]
```

6. **AI agents update their positions based on the retrieved embeddings.**

```python
def update_agent_positions(agents, queried_embeddings):
    for agent, embedding in zip(agents, queried_embeddings):
        agent.update_position(embedding)

update_agent_positions(agents, queried_embeddings)
```

7. **Evaluate the performance of the swarm and update the agents' behavior accordingly.**

```python
def evaluate_swarm_performance(agents, ...):
    # Evaluate the performance of the swarm
    performance = compute_performance_metric(agents, ...)
    return performance

def update_agent_behavior(agents, performance):
    # Update agents' behavior based on swarm performance
    for agent in agents:
        agent.adjust_behavior(performance)

performance = evaluate_swarm_performance(agents, ...)
update_agent_behavior(agents, performance)
```

8. **Repeat steps 3-7 until a stopping criterion is met.**

```python
while not stopping_criterion_met():
    # Perform tasks and generate embeddings
    embeddings = [agent_perform_task(agent, task) for agent, task in zip(agents, tasks)]

    # Store embeddings in the Ocean database
    store_embeddings_in_database(embeddings, collection)

    # Query the Ocean database for relevant embeddings
    queried_embeddings = [query_database_for_embeddings(agent, collection) for agent in agents]

    # Update AI agent positions based on the retrieved embeddings
    update_agent_positions(agents, queried_embeddings)

    # Evaluate the performance of the swarm and update the agents' behavior accordingly
    performance = evaluate_swarm_performance(agents, ...)
    update_agent_behavior(agents, performance)
```

This code demonstrates the complete loop to repeat steps 3-7 until a stopping criterion is met. You will need to define the `stopping_criterion_met()` function, which could be based on a predefined number of iterations, a target performance level, or any other condition that indicates that the swarm has reached a desired state.




* Integrate petals to handle huggingface LLM



# Orchestrator
* Takes in an agent class with vector store, then handles all the communication and scales up a swarm with number of agents and handles task assignment and task completion

```python

from swarms import OpenAI, Orchestrator, Swarm

orchestrated = Orchestrate(OpenAI, nodes=40) #handles all the task assignment and allocation and agent communication using a vectorstore as a universal communication layer and also handlles the task completion logic

Objective = "Make a business website for a marketing consultancy"

Swarms = (Swarms(orchestrated, auto=True, Objective))
```

In terms of architecture, the swarm might look something like this:

```
                                           (Orchestrator)
                                             /        \
           Tools + Vector DB -- (LLM Agent)---(Communication Layer)       (Communication Layer)---(LLM Agent)-- Tools + Vector DB 
              /                  |                                           |                 \
(Task Assignment)      (Task Completion)                    (Task Assignment)       (Task Completion)
```

Each LLM agent communicates with the orchestrator through a dedicated communication layer. The orchestrator assigns tasks to each LLM agent, which the agents then complete and return. This setup allows for a high degree of flexibility, scalability, and robustness.

In the context of swarm LLMs, one could consider an **Omni-Vector Embedding Database** for communication. This database could store and manage the high-dimensional vectors produced by each LLM agent.

- Strengths: This approach would allow for similarity-based lookup and matching of LLM-generated vectors, which can be particularly useful for tasks that involve finding similar outputs or recognizing patterns.

- Weaknesses: An Omni-Vector Embedding Database might add complexity to the system in terms of setup and maintenance. It might also require significant computational resources, depending on the volume of data being handled and the complexity of the vectors. The handling and transmission of high-dimensional vectors could also pose challenges in terms of network load.



* Handling absurdly long sequences => first transform the objective if it's more than 1000tokens into a txt file similiar to how Claude works => then chunk it into sizes of 8000 seq length embeddings => then embed it and store in the vector database => then connext the agent model to it
