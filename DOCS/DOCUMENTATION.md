## LLM
### Purpose
The `LLM` class provides an interface to different language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Hugging Face models. It allows you to initialize and run a language model with a given prompt and obtain the generated response.

### Systems Understanding
The `LLM` class takes an OpenAI API key or Hugging Face repository ID and API token as input. It uses these credentials to initialize the language model, either from OpenAI's models or from a specific Hugging Face repository. The language model can then be run with a prompt, and the generated response is returned.

### Usage Example
```python
from swarms import LLM

# Create an instance of LLM with OpenAI API key
llm_instance = LLM(openai_api_key="your_openai_key")

# Run the language model with a prompt
result = llm_instance.run("Who won the FIFA World Cup in 1998?")
print(result)

# Create an instance of LLM with Hugging Face repository ID and API token
llm_instance = LLM(hf_repo_id="google/flan-t5-xl", hf_api_token="your_hf_api_token")

# Run the language model with a prompt
result = llm_instance.run("Who won the FIFA World Cup in 1998?")
print(result)
```

### Constructor
```python
def __init__(self, openai_api_key: Optional[str] = None,
             hf_repo_id: Optional[str] = None,
             hf_api_token: Optional[str] = None,
             model_kwargs: Optional[dict] = None)
```
- `openai_api_key` (optional): The API key for OpenAI's models.
- `hf_repo_id` (optional): The repository ID for the Hugging Face model.
- `hf_api_token` (optional): The API token for the Hugging Face model.
- `model_kwargs` (optional): Additional keyword arguments to pass to the language model.

### Methods
- `run(prompt: str) -> str`: Runs the language model with the given prompt and returns the generated response.

### Args
- `prompt` (str): The prompt to be passed to the language model.

### Returns
- `result` (str): The generated response from the language model.

## Conclusion
The `LLM` class provides a convenient way to initialize and run different language models using either OpenAI's API or Hugging Face models. By providing the necessary credentials and a prompt, you can obtain the generated response from the language model.






# `GooglePalm` class:

### Example 1: Using Dictionaries as Messages

```python
from google_palm import GooglePalm

# Initialize the GooglePalm instance
gp = GooglePalm(
    client=your_client,
    model_name="models/chat-bison-001",
    temperature=0.7,
    top_p=0.9,
    top_k=10,
    n=5
)

# Create some messages
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
]

# Generate a response
response = gp.generate(messages)

# Print the generated response
print(response)
```

### Example 2: Using BaseMessage and Its Subclasses as Messages

```python
from google_palm import GooglePalm
from langchain.schema.messages import SystemMessage, HumanMessage

# Initialize the GooglePalm instance
gp = GooglePalm(
    client=your_client,
    model_name="models/chat-bison-001",
    temperature=0.7,
    top_p=0.9,
    top_k=10,
    n=5
)

# Create some messages
messages = [
    SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
    HumanMessage(content="Who won the world series in 2020?"),
]

# Generate a response
response = gp.generate(messages)

# Print the generated response
print(response)
```

### Example 3: Using GooglePalm with Asynchronous Function

```python
import asyncio
from google_palm import GooglePalm
from langchain.schema.messages import SystemMessage, HumanMessage

# Initialize the GooglePalm instance
gp = GooglePalm(
    client=your_client,
    model_name="models/chat-bison-001",
    temperature=0.7,
    top_p=0.9,
    top_k=10,
    n=5
)

# Create some messages
messages = [
    SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
    HumanMessage(content="Who won the world series in 2020?"),
]

# Define an asynchronous function
async def generate_response():
    response = await gp._agenerate(messages)
    print(response)

# Run the asynchronous function
asyncio.run(generate_response())
```

Remember to replace `your_client` with an actual instance of your client. Also, ensure the `model_name` is the correct name of the model that you want to use.

The `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, and `n` parameters control the randomness and diversity of the generated responses. You can adjust these parameters based on your application's requirements.





## `CodeInterpreterTool`:

```python
tool = CodeInterpreterTool("Code Interpreter", "A tool to interpret code and generate useful outputs.")
tool.run("Plot the bitcoin chart of 2023 YTD")

# Or with file inputs
tool.run("Analyze this dataset and plot something interesting about it.", ["examples/assets/iris.csv"])
```

To use the asynchronous version, simply replace `run` with `arun` and ensure your calling code is in an async context:

```python
import asyncio

tool = CodeInterpreterTool("Code Interpreter", "A tool to interpret code and generate useful outputs.")
asyncio.run(tool.arun("Plot the bitcoin chart of 2023 YTD"))

# Or with file inputs
asyncio.run(tool.arun("Analyze this dataset and plot something interesting about it.", ["examples/assets/iris.csv"]))
```

The `CodeInterpreterTool` class is a flexible tool that uses the `CodeInterpreterSession` from the `codeinterpreterapi` package to run the code interpretation and return the result. It provides both synchronous and asynchronous methods for convenience, and ensures that exceptions are handled gracefully.
