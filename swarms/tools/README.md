Here are 20 tools the individual worker swarm nodes can use:

1. Write File Tool: Create a new file and write content to it.
2. Read File Tool: Open and read the content of an existing file.
3. Copy File Tool: Duplicate a file.
4. Delete File Tool: Remove a file.
5. Rename File Tool: Rename a file.
6. Web Search Tool: Use a web search engine (like Google or DuckDuckGo) to find information.
7. API Call Tool: Make requests to APIs.
8. Process CSV Tool: Load a CSV file and perform operations on it using pandas.
9. Create Directory Tool: Create a new directory.
10. List Directory Tool: List all the files in a directory.
11. Install Package Tool: Install Python packages using pip.
12. Code Compilation Tool: Compile and run code in different languages.
13. System Command Tool: Execute system commands.
14. Image Processing Tool: Perform operations on images (resizing, cropping, etc.).
15. PDF Processing Tool: Read, write, and manipulate PDF files.
16. Text Processing Tool: Perform text processing operations like tokenization, stemming, etc.
17. Email Sending Tool: Send emails.
18. Database Query Tool: Execute SQL queries on a database.
19. Data Scraping Tool: Scrape data from web pages.
20. Version Control Tool: Perform Git operations.

The architecture for these tools involves creating a base `Tool` class that can be extended for each specific tool. The base `Tool` class would define common properties and methods that all tools would use.

The pseudocode for each tool would follow a similar structure:

```
Class ToolNameTool extends Tool:
    Define properties specific to the tool

    Method run: 
        Perform the specific action of the tool
        Return the result
```

Here's an example of how you might define the WriteFileTool:

```python
import os
from langchain.tools import BaseTool

class WriteFileTool(BaseTool):
    name = "write_file"
    description = "Create a new file and write content to it."

    def __init__(self, root_dir: str):
        self.root_dir = root_dir

    def _run(self, file_name: str, content: str) -> str:
        """Creates a new file and writes the content."""
        try:
            with open(os.path.join(self.root_dir, file_name), 'w') as f:
                f.write(content)
            return f"Successfully wrote to {file_name}"
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Error: {e}"
```

This tool takes the name of the file and the content to be written as parameters, writes the content to the file in the specified directory, and returns a success message. In case of any error, it returns the error message. You would follow a similar process to create the other tools.
