# Open-Sourcerer: The Code Sorcerer's Apprentice
![Sourcerer](Open-Sourcerer.jpg)

Greetings, fellow developer! Welcome to the realm of the Open-Sourcerer, your trusty assistant in the magical world of open source projects. Open-Sourcerer is here to assist you in finding, integrating, and mastering the arcane arts of open source code.

## Introduction

Open-Sourcerer is your magical companion, capable of traversing the vast landscapes of the internet, particularly GitHub, to discover open source projects that align with your desires. It can also lend you a hand in weaving these projects into your own creations.

### How Does Open-Sourcerer Work?

Open-Sourcerer operates in two phases: 

1. **Discovery**: It explores the realms of GitHub to unearth repositories that resonate with your quest. 

2. **Integration and Assistance**: Once you've chosen your allies (repositories), Open-Sourcerer helps you integrate them into your own codebase. It can even conjure code snippets to assist you.

## Installation

Before embarking on this mystical journey, ensure you have the following:

- Python (version X.X.X)
- Git (version X.X.X)
- Your favorite code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

Now, let's summon the Open-Sourcerer:

```shell
pip install open-sourcerer
```

## Configuration

Open-Sourcerer must be attuned to your intentions. Let's configure it:

```shell
open-sourcerer configure
```

Follow the instructions to set up your preferences, such as the programming languages and search keywords that align with your project.
