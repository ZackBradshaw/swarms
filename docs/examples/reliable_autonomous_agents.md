Now let’s begin…

## Installation
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

Python installed on your system.
The swarms library installed. You can install it via pip using the following command:

`pip3 install --upgrade swarms`

Additionally, you will need an API key for the OpenAIChat model to run the provided code examples. Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual API key in the code examples where applicable.

## Getting Started
Let’s start by importing the necessary modules and initializing the OpenAIChat model, which we will use in our workflow tasks.


```python
from swarms.models import OpenAIChat
from swarms.structs import Flow
from swarms.structs.sequential_workflow import SequentialWorkflow

# Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual OpenAI API key
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# Initialize the language model flow (e.g., GPT-3)
llm = OpenAIChat(
    openai_api_key=api_key,
    temperature=0.5,
    max_tokens=3000,
)
We have initialized the OpenAIChat model, which will be used as a callable object in our tasks. Now, let’s proceed to create the SequentialWorkflow.

Creating a SequentialWorkflow
To create a SequentialWorkflow, follow these steps:

# Initialize Flows for individual tasks
flow1 = Flow(llm=llm, max_loops=1, dashboard=False)
flow2 = Flow(llm=llm, max_loops=1, dashboard=False)
# Create the Sequential Workflow
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(max_loops=1)
``````
In this code snippet, we have initialized two Flow instances (flow1 and flow2) representing individual tasks within our workflow. These flows will use the OpenAIChat model we initialized earlier. We then create a SequentialWorkflow instance named workflow with a maximum loop count of 1. The max_loops parameter determines how many times the entire workflow can be run, and we set it to 1 for this example.

Adding Tasks to the SequentialWorkflow
Now that we have created the SequentialWorkflow, let’s add tasks to it. In our example, we’ll create two tasks: one for generating a 10,000-word blog on “health and wellness” and another for summarizing the generated blog.

```
### Add tasks to the workflow
workflow.add("Generate a 10,000 word blog on health and wellness.", flow1)

`workflow.add("Summarize the generated blog", flow2)`

The workflow.add() method is used to add tasks to the workflow. Each task is described using a human-readable description, such as "Generate a 10,000 word blog on health and wellness," and is associated with a flow (callable object) that will be executed as the task. In our example, flow1 and flow2 represent the tasks.

Running the SequentialWorkflow
With tasks added to the SequentialWorkflow, we can now run the workflow sequentially using the workflow.run() method.

### Run the workflow
`workflow.run()`
Executing workflow.run() will start the execution of tasks in the order they were added to the workflow. In our example, it will first generate the blog and then summarize it.

Accessing Task Results
After running the workflow, you can access the results of each task using the get_task_results() method.

# Get and display the results of each task in the workflow
```python
results = workflow.get_task_results()
for task_description, result in results.items():
    print(f"Task: {task_description}, Result: {result}")
```
The workflow.get_task_results() method returns a dictionary where the keys are task descriptions, and the values are the corresponding results. You can then iterate through the results and print them, as shown in the code snippet.

Resetting a SequentialWorkflow
Sometimes, you might need to reset a SequentialWorkflow to start fresh. You can use the workflow.reset_workflow() method for this purpose.

### Reset the workflow
`workflow.reset_workflow()`
Resetting the workflow clears the results of each task, allowing you to rerun the workflow from the beginning without reinitializing it.

Updating Task Arguments
You can also update the arguments of a specific task in the workflow using the workflow.update_task() method.

### Update the arguments of a specific task in the workflow
`workflow.update_task("Generate a 10,000 word blog on health and wellness.", max_loops=2)`

In this example, we update the max_loops argument of the task with the description "Generate a 10,000 word blog on health and wellness" to 2. This can be useful if you want to change the behavior of a specific task without recreating the entire workflow.
