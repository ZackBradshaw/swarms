## ðŸ‘‹ Hello

Swarms provides you with all the building blocks you need to build reliable, production-grade, and scalable multi-agent apps!

## ðŸ’» Install

You can install `swarms` with pip in a
[**Python>=3.8**](https://www.python.org/) environment.

!!! example "pip install (recommended)"

    === "headless"
        The headless installation of `swarms` is designed for environments where graphical user interfaces (GUI) are not needed, making it more lightweight and suitable for server-side applications.

        ```bash
        pip install swarms
        ```


!!! example "git clone (for development)"

    === "virtualenv"

        ```bash
        # clone repository and navigate to root directory
        git clone https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms.git
        cd swarms

        # setup python environment and activate it
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        pip install --upgrade pip

        # headless install
        pip install -e "."

        # desktop install
        pip install -e ".[desktop]"
        ```

    === "poetry"

        ```bash
        # clone repository and navigate to root directory
        git clone https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms.git
        cd swarms

        # setup python environment and activate it
        poetry env use python3.10
        poetry shell

        # headless install
        poetry install

        # desktop install
        poetry install --extras "desktop"
        ```
