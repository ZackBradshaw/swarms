# AnthropicTokenizer Documentation

## Introduction

This documentation intends to provide a complete and in-depth guide for using the `AnthropicTokenizer` class within the `swarms.tokenizers` library. The `AnthropicTokenizer` is designed specifically to interface with Anthropic's AI models, primarily used for text tokenization and metadata handling.

Understanding how to use this tokenizer effectively is crucial for developers and researchers working with natural language processing, machine learning, and text analysis using Anthropic AI models.

The purpose of the `AnthropicTokenizer` is to convert raw text into a sequence of tokens that can be fed into Anthropic AI models for various tasks. Tokenization is a fundamental step in text processing pipelines and affects the performance of AI models.

## Class Definition: AnthropicTokenizer

`AnthropicTokenizer` extends the functionality of a base tokenizer to provide features specifically needed for Anthropic AI models. The class is designed to manage tokenization processes such as counting tokens and ensuring that the token count is under a specified limit, which is essential for effective and efficient model performance.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter Name            | Type      | Description                                                     | Default Value |
|---------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `max_tokens`              | `int`     | Maximum number of tokens permitted.                             | `500`         |
| `client`                  | `Anthropic` | Instance of an `Anthropic` client for tokenization services.   | `None`        |
| `model`                   | `str`     | Identifier for the Anthropic model in use.                      | `"claude-2.1"`|

**Methods and their descriptions:**

| Method Name          | Return Type | Description                                                  |
|----------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `__post_init__`      | `None`      | Initializes default parameters and client instance.          |
| `default_max_tokens` | `int`       | Returns the default maximum number of tokens.                |
| `count_tokens`       | `int`       | Counts tokens in the input text. Raises a ValueError if the input is not a string. |

## Architecture and Mechanics

Upon instantiation, `AnthropicTokenizer` initializes its `max_tokens` limit and sets up a client to interact with the Anthropic services. The client is responsible for providing tokenization functions critical for processing the text inputs.

The tokenizer employs a dictionary to map specific model prefixes to their maximum token counts. This allows users to adapt the tokenizer's behavior to different models with varying token limits. The `default_max_tokens()` method dynamically retrieves the token limit based on the provided model name, ensuring compatibility and flexibility.

`count_tokens()` is a critical function that calculates the number of tokens in a given text. This functionality is essential for respecting the model's token limit and ensuring accurate processing by the Anthropic AI.

## Usage Examples

Before delving into detailed examples, make sure you have `swarms.tokenizers` installed and ready. If `anthropic` is an optional dependency, ensure that it's installed as well.

### 1. Tokenizing with Default Settings

```python
from swarms.tokenizers import AnthropicTokenizer

# Initialize the tokenizer with default settings
tokenizer = AnthropicTokenizer()

# Tokenize a sample text
text = "Hello world! This is an example text to tokenize."
token_count = tokenizer.count_tokens(text)

print(f"Number of tokens: {token_count}")
```

In this example, we use the `AnthropicTokenizer` to count the number of tokens in a simple text. The token count can be crucial for managing inputs to the AI model.

### 2. Tokenizing with Custom Model

```python
from swarms.tokenizers import AnthropicTokenizer

# Define a custom model
custom_model = "claude"

# Initialize the tokenizer with a custom model and max_tokens
tokenizer = AnthropicTokenizer(model=custom_model, max_tokens=1000)

# Process a larger text
large_text = "..."  # Assume large_text is a string with meaningful content

token_count = tokenizer.count_tokens(large_text)
if token_count > tokenizer.max_tokens:
    print("Text exceeds the maximum token limit.")
else:
    print(f"Token count within limit: {token_count}")
```

This snippet demonstrates setting up the tokenizer for a custom model and a higher maximum token limit. It is helpful when dealing with texts larger than the default token limit.

### 3. Handling Error in Token Count Function

```python
from swarms.tokenizers import AnthropicTokenizer

# Initialize the tokenizer
tokenizer = AnthropicTokenizer()

# Attempt to tokenize a non-string input (which will raise an error)
non_string_input = ["This", "is", "a", "list", "not", "a", "string"]

try:
    tokenizer.count_tokens(non_string_input)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

This example illustrates the error management within the `count_tokens` method. It is important to handle exceptions gracefully, particularly when a non-string input is provided.

## Additional Tips and Considerations

- Always ensure the input text is a string before calling `count_tokens` to avoid unnecessary errors.
- Be aware of the `max_tokens` limit since larger models might have significantly higher limits than defaults.
- When tokenizing large datasets, batch processing with a loop or parallelization might provide better performance.
