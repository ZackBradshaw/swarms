# Module Name: Mixtral

## Introduction
The Mixtral module is a powerful language model designed for text generation tasks. It leverages the MistralAI Mixtral-8x7B pre-trained model to generate high-quality text based on user-defined tasks or prompts. In this documentation, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the Mixtral module, including its architecture, purpose, arguments, and detailed usage examples.

## Purpose
The Mixtral module is designed to facilitate text generation tasks using state-of-the-art language models. Whether you need to generate creative content, draft text for various applications, or simply explore the capabilities of Mixtral, this module serves as a versatile and efficient solution. With its easy-to-use interface, you can quickly generate text for a wide range of applications.

## Architecture
The Mixtral module is built on top of the MistralAI Mixtral-8x7B pre-trained model. It utilizes a deep neural network architecture with 8 layers and 7 attention heads to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. The model is capable of handling a variety of text generation tasks, from simple prompts to more complex content generation.

## Class Definition
### `Mixtral(model_name: str = "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1", max_new_tokens: int = 500)`

#### Parameters
- `model_name` (str, optional): The name or path of the pre-trained Mixtral model. Default is "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1".
- `max_new_tokens` (int, optional): The maximum number of new tokens to generate. Default is 500.

## Functionality and Usage
The Mixtral module offers a straightforward interface for text generation. It accepts a task or prompt as input and returns generated text based on the provided input.

### `run(task: Optional[str] = None, **kwargs) -> str`

#### Parameters
- `task` (str, optional): The task or prompt for text generation.

#### Returns
- `str`: The generated text.

## Usage Examples
### Example 1: Basic Usage

```python
from swarms.models import Mixtral

# Initialize the Mixtral model
mixtral = Mixtral()

# Generate text for a simple task
generated_text = mixtral.run("Generate a creative story.")
print(generated_text)
```

### Example 2: Custom Model

You can specify a custom pre-trained model by providing the `model_name` parameter.

```python
custom_model_name = "model_name"
mixtral_custom = Mixtral(model_name=custom_model_name)

generated_text = mixtral_custom.run("Generate text with a custom model.")
print(generated_text)
```

### Example 3: Controlling Output Length

You can control the length of the generated text by adjusting the `max_new_tokens` parameter.

```python
mixtral_length = Mixtral(max_new_tokens=100)

generated_text = mixtral_length.run("Generate a short text.")
print(generated_text)
```

## Additional Information and Tips
- It's recommended to use a descriptive task or prompt to guide the text generation process.
- Experiment with different prompt styles and lengths to achieve the desired output.
- You can fine-tune Mixtral on specific tasks if needed, although pre-trained models often work well out of the box.
- Monitor the `max_new_tokens` parameter to control the length of the generated text.

## Conclusion
The Mixtral module is a versatile tool for text generation tasks, powered by the MistralAI Mixtral-8x7B pre-trained model. Whether you need creative writing, content generation, or assistance with text-based tasks, Mixtral can help you achieve your goals. With a simple interface and flexible parameters, it's a valuable addition to your text generation toolkit.
