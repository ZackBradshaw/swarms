hey guys, we out here testing out swarms which is a multi-modal agent 
framework which potentially makes all the agents work in a single pot 
for instance take an empty pot and place all the known agents in that 
pot and output a well structured answer out of it 

that's basically it, we belive that a multi-agent framework beats a single 
agent framework which is not really rocket science 

ight first we gotta make sure out evn clean, install python3-pip,
this runs on python3.10 

our current version of swarms==4.1.0

make sure you in a virtual env or conda 

just do 
	$ python3 -m venv ~/.venv
	$ source ~/.venv/bin/active

then boom we in a virtual env LFG

now for the best we install swarms

	$ pip3 instll --upgrade swamrs==4.1.0
