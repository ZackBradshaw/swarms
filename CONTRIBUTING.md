# Contributing to Swarms üõ†Ô∏è

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Swarms!

We are actively improving this library to reduce the amount of work you need to do to solve common computer vision problems.

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions to:

1. Add a new feature to the library (guidance below).
2. Improve our documentation and add examples to make it clear how to leverage the swarms library.
3. Report bugs and issues in the project.
4. Submit a request for a new feature.
5. Improve our test coverage.

Swarms is designed to provide modular building blocks to build scalable swarms of autonomous agents!

Before you contribute a new feature, consider submitting an Issue to discuss the feature so the community can weigh in and assist.

- New classes or functions should be added with documentation in docstrings and error handling.
- New class and or function Module with documentation in docstrings with error handling
- Tests using pytest in tests folder in the same module folder
- Documentation in the docs/swarms/module_name folder and then added into the mkdocs.yml


## How to Contribute Changes

First, fork this repository to your own GitHub account. Click "fork" in the top corner of the `swarms` repository to get started:

Then, run `git clone` to download the project code to your computer.

Move to a new branch using the `git checkout` command:

```bash
git checkout -b <your_branch_name>
```

The name you choose for your branch should describe the change you want to make (i.e. `line-counter-docs`).

Make any changes you want to the project code, then run the following commands to commit your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push -u origin main
```

## üé® Code quality
- Follow the following guide on code quality a python guide or your PR will most likely be overlooked: [CLICK HERE](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)



###¬†Pre-commit tool

This project utilizes the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) tool to maintain code quality and consistency. Before submitting a pull request or making any commits, it is important to run the pre-commit tool to ensure that your changes meet the project's guidelines.


- Install pre-commit (https://pre-commit.com/)

```bash

```

- Now when you make a git commit, the black code formatter and ruff linter will run.

```bash
pre-commit --version
```

Now when you make a git commit, the black code formatter and ruff linter will run.

Furthermore, we have integrated a pre-commit GitHub Action into our workflow. This means that with every pull request opened, the pre-commit checks will be automatically enforced, streamlining the code review process and ensuring that all contributions adhere to our quality standards.

To run the pre-commit tool, follow these steps:

1. Install pre-commit by running the following command: `poetry install dev`. It will not only install pre-commit but also install all the deps and dev-deps of project

2. Once pre-commit is installed, navigate to the project's root directory.

3. Run the command `pre-commit run --all-files`. This will execute the pre-commit hooks configured for this project against the modified files. If any issues are found, the pre-commit tool will provide feedback on how to resolve them. Make the necessary changes and re-run the pre-commit command until all issues are resolved.

4. You can also install pre-commit as a git hook by execute `pre-commit install`. Every time you made `git commit` pre-commit run automatically for you.


### Docstrings

All new functions and classes in `swarms` should include docstrings. This is a prerequisite for any new functions and classes to be added to the library.

`swarms` adheres to the [Google Python docstring style](https://google.github.io/python-styleguide/python_style_rules.html#383-functions-and-methods). Please refer to the style guide while writing docstrings for your contribution.

### Type checking

Then, go back to your fork of the `swarms` repository, click "Pull Requests", and click "New Pull Request".

Make sure the `base` branch is `develop` before submitting your PR.

On the next page, review your changes then click "Create pull request":

Next, write a description for your pull request, and click "Create pull request" again to submit it for review:

When creating new functions, please ensure you have the following:

1. Docstrings for the function and all parameters.
2. Unit tests for the function.
3. Examples in the documentation for the function.
4. Created an entry in our docs to autogenerate the documentation for the function.
5. Please share a Google Colab with minimal code to test new feature or reproduce PR whenever it is possible. Please ensure that Google Colab can be accessed without any issue.

All pull requests will be reviewed by the maintainers of the project. We will provide feedback and ask for changes if necessary.

PRs must pass all tests and linting requirements before they can be merged.

## üìù documentation

The `swarms` documentation is stored in a folder called `docs`. The project documentation is built using `mkdocs`.

To run the documentation, install the project requirements with `poetry install dev`. Then, run `mkdocs serve` to start the documentation server.

You can learn more about mkdocs on the [mkdocs website](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

## üß™ tests
- Run all the tests in the tests folder
   ```pytest .```
   
## Code Quality
(Code quality instructions removed for relevance to this issue)

3. Make sure the script has execute permissions:
   ```sh
   chmod +x code_quality.sh
   ```

4. Run the script:
   ```sh
   ./code-quality.sh
   ```
   
If the script requires administrative privileges, you might need to run it with `sudo`:
```sh
sudo ./code-quality.sh
```

Please replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path where the `code-quality.sh` script is located on your system.

If you're asking for a specific content or functionality inside `code-quality.sh` related to YAPF or other code quality tools, you would need to edit the `code-quality.sh` script to include the desired commands, such as running YAPF on a directory. The contents of `code-quality.sh` would dictate exactly what happens when you run it.
